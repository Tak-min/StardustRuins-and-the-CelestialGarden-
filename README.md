Game Overview: Stardust Ruins and the Endless Journey
This is a serene 3D exploration game where you become a robot, a final creation left behind by a fallen civilization. You will journey alone through a series of distinct worlds, connected only by ancient portals. In this journey without a clear purpose or end, you are invited to simply seek out the beauty of these worlds and the faint light that lies dormant within them.

The Traveler and the Worlds
You are the traveler, a robot that stands as the masterpiece of a civilization now gone. Awakening from a long slumber, you find yourself in a vast world bereft of its masters.

The stage for this game is not just one location, but many. You will discover multiple, isolated worlds, each with its own unique character—from a giant, deserted island resting in the silence of the sea, to a vast desert island floating in the sky. By passing through ancient portals found within these realms, you can travel freely between them.

The Glimmer of Starlight
Within each world lie dormant "Starlight Shards," fragments that once adorned the sky. There are no treasure chests or containers; the shards themselves simply emit a faint, gentle light from a corner of the terrain or the top of an ancient structure.

Your task is to explore these beautiful yet desolate landscapes to find and gather these scattered pieces of light. The act of finding them becomes the only tangible objective of your journey.

A Journey Without End
This story does not offer a defined conclusion. Even after you have journeyed through all the worlds and gathered every last shard, no special event or ending sequence will play.

The game does not depict a triumphant finale or a new beginning. Instead, it portrays the endless journey of a solitary robot, which simply continues. The experience is not about the catharsis of completing a final goal. Rather, it is about finding the pure joy and quiet melancholy that exist only in the process itself—the act of exploring these silent worlds and discovering each small, beautiful glimmer of light.
